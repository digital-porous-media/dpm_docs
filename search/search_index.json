Our mission is multi-faceted: Organize and Preserve: We provide a robust platform to securely store, organize, and preserve valuable imaged datasets and related experimental measurements of porous materials, primarily focusing on subsurface media like rocks and soil. Connect and Analyze: We strive to link these datasets with simulation, analysis, and visualization tools, thereby enhancing their scientific utility and enabling deeper insights. Educate and Collaborate: We are committed to supporting the research community by offering educational resources, organizing workshops and challenges, and fostering collaboration through data sharing. Understanding the complex processes of flow, transport, and deformation within porous media is fundamental to addressing critical challenges in environmental science, civil engineering, petroleum engineering, and basic geology. The DPM aims to accelerate research and education in these important fields by providing access to high-quality data. Scope and Content Policy The Digital Porous Media Portal is specifically designed to host datasets pertinent to the study of porous materials. This includes, but is not limited to: 2D and 3D images (e.g., from X-ray CT, micro-CT, FIB-SEM, SEM) Associated experimental data (e.g., core analysis, petrophysical measurements) Simulation inputs and results derived from these materials. We require that users contributing data ensure their submissions are scientifically relevant, clearly described, well-organized, and reusable. High-quality metadata is essential for making datasets discoverable, understandable, and valuable to the broader community. Datasets submitted without sufficient descriptive metadata, proper attribution, or in formats currently unsupported by the portal may require revision before public release. For detailed guidelines, please consult our How to Upload Data guide and the official User Agreement , which outlines curation standards and the publication process.

There are several parts to adding a new user to a project portal: Initial Steps for User Access Step 1: User Request * The user must submit a ticket requesting access to the project portal. This ticket will be fielded to the Principal Investigator (PI). Step 2: PI Adds User in TACC Portal * If the PI approves the request, they must add the user to the Project and Allocations within the TACC User Portal. * TACC Portal Link: https://tacc.utexas.edu/portal/projects Step 3: PI Approves User in Project Portal * After adding the user to the Project and Allocations in the TACC Portal, the PI must then go to the Project Portal's onboarding admin section to \"Approve\" the new user requests. * DPM Onboarding Admin Link: https://digitalporousmedia.org/workbench/onboarding/admin Subsequent User Administration Actions (Onboarding Admin Dashboard) Once a user has requested access, their status and onboarding progress can be managed in the project portal onboarding admin dashboard. Awaiting Approval: Users who have requested access and are awaiting PI approval for onboarding will appear in the dashboard. Approving a User: Clicking the \"Approve\" button next to a user's request will send an email to the user. This email asks them to verify their request for access to the specific portal. Once the user responds to the verification email, the Project Portal will attempt to execute the onboarding workflow for that user. Successfully Onboarded Users: Users who have been successfully processed for onboarding will be displayed accordingly. Handling Onboarding Errors: If a user fails a check during the onboarding process (e.g., Project Membership check, Allocations check, or System Access check) after PI approval, a log of the error will be available. These logs can be accessed by clicking the \"view log\" link next to each step in the procedure for that user. Manual Step Management (Reset/Skip): If a user is stuck on a specific onboarding step, the PI has options: Reset: Clicking the \"Reset\" link next to the failing step will attempt to re-run that step. This is often useful if a blocking issue (like missing Project/Allocation assignment or delayed System Access key generation) has since been resolved. Skip: If an onboarding step is blocking the user and the PI is confident in allowing the user access despite the error, they can click the \"Skip\" link to bypass that particular step in the workflow. Note: Any users for whom steps were \"skipped\" should be investigated to identify and resolve the underlying blocker.

Following these steps helps ensure your data is well-described, discoverable, and usable by the community. Before You Begin: Account: Ensure you have registered for a TACC account at https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register and are logged into the DPM. Data Organization: Plan the structure of your data. Consider distinguishing between originating raw data and derived analysis data. It's often helpful to organize your files and folders locally on your computer or cloud storage (like Dropbox/UT Box) before uploading. File Size: If your total dataset exceeds 2GB , please email the DPM staff first to discuss the upload. Consider splitting very large volumetric files into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., under 2GB each) before uploading. This aids users with downloading and processing the data later. Compression: Avoid compressing individual image files (e.g., into .zip or .tar.gz archives) before uploading if possible. Uploading raw or standard image formats directly allows the portal to automatically generate previews (like GIF movies) and perform basic analysis (like histograms). Use the portal's bulk upload options (Dropbox, UTBox) for transferring many files or large files efficiently. Step 1: Create or Select a Project All data on DPM belongs to a \"Project\". Log in to the DPM and navigate to the \"My Projects\" interface. Choose one: Create a New Project: Click the option to create a new project. Provide a descriptive name. Note on Ownership: For citation purposes, it's best if the primary data author is the project owner. If someone else (e.g., a student or assistant) will be uploading the data, the data owner should ideally create the project and then add the uploader as a collaborator (see Step 2). Use an Existing Project: If you are adding data to a project you previously created, simply navigate to and open that project. Step 2: Add Collaborators (Optional) If members of your team need to help manage the project or view the data while it's still private: Ensure your collaborators are registered users on the DPM. Within your project's management interface, find the option to add collaborators. Add them using their registered DPM/TACC username or email. Collaborators can then edit the project and upload data. Step 3: Upload Your Data Files Inside your selected project, find the data upload section or button. Choose your preferred upload method: Dropbox: Link your Dropbox account to transfer files directly. UTBox: Link your UTBox account (if applicable) to transfer files directly. Drag-and-Drop: Drag files or folders directly from your computer onto the designated upload area in your web browser. Select the prepared files/folders and start the upload process. Monitor the progress as indicated by the interface. Step 4: Add Metadata (Crucial!) Metadata (data about your data) is essential for making your dataset understandable and usable. You will be prompted to add metadata for your project and individual files. Project Description: Provide a clear description of the overall project, the physical sample(s), and the experiment(s) involved. Link to relevant publications if available. File-Level Metadata: For each uploaded data file (especially images), provide necessary details. Minimum Requirements: The DPM enforces minimum metadata standards. Pay attention to warnings indicating missing required information. The more detail you provide, the more valuable your dataset becomes. Critical Metadata for Raw Binary Images: Raw binary files ( .raw , .bin , etc.) do not contain size or format information internally. To allow DPM to display them correctly, you must provide: Voxel Dimensions: The number of voxels (pixels in 3D) in each direction (e.g., width, height, depth/slices). Voxel Size: The physical size of one voxel (e.g., in \u00b5m). If not applicable (e.g., for synthetic data), enter '1' and make a note in the description. Data Type: The numerical format (e.g., 8-bit unsigned integer, 16-bit signed integer, 32-bit float). Byte Order (Endianness): Specify 'Big Endian' or 'Little Endian'. This is critical for multi-byte data types (16-bit, 32-bit, etc.). If unsure, you might need to try both \u2013 upload the metadata, check the preview (Step 5), and edit if it looks scrambled. (Note: For 8-bit data, byte order doesn't typically matter). Tip: If unsure about these parameters, try opening your raw file in software like ImageJ/Fiji locally first to determine the correct settings. Step 5: Verify Previews (Especially for Volumetric Images) After the upload and metadata entry, the portal will often attempt to generate a preview (e.g., a GIF movie slicing through a 3D volume). Check the preview on the project page. Does it look as expected? Troubleshooting Low-Range Binary Data: If you uploaded segmented data (e.g., values 0, 1, 2) as a raw binary file, the preview might initially look black or very dark. This is because the visualizer scales to the full potential range (e.g., 0-255 for 8-bit). To fix this: Navigate to the specific image file within your project. Click the \"Actions\" tab/button associated with that file. Select \"Edit\" . Find and check the option labeled \"Use binary correction\" (or similar wording). Save Changes . The task to re-render the preview will be queued, and it should update shortly to display the limited range correctly. Step 6: Review and Finalize Your uploaded data is now stored privately within your project. Review all uploaded files and metadata for accuracy and completeness. You can continue to add/edit data and metadata while the project remains private. Once you are satisfied and ready to make the data public, you can proceed with the publication request process (covered in the \"Publish Datasets\" guide - publish.md ). Metadata cannot be easily edited by you after publication. For further details on specific file formats or metadata fields, please refer to the relevant sections of the documentation. If you encounter issues, contact the DPM support team.","title":"Upload Data"},{"location":"upload_data/#how-to-upload-data-a-step-by-step-guide","text":"This guide provides step-by-step instructions for uploading your porous media datasets to the Digital Porous Media Portal (DPM). Following these steps helps ensure your data is well-described, discoverable, and usable by the community. Before You Begin: Account: Ensure you have registered for a TACC account at https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/register and are logged into the DPM. Data Organization: Plan the structure of your data. Consider distinguishing between originating raw data and derived analysis data. It's often helpful to organize your files and folders locally on your computer or cloud storage (like Dropbox/UT Box) before uploading. File Size: If your total dataset exceeds 2GB , please email the DPM staff first to discuss the upload. Consider splitting very large volumetric files into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., under 2GB each) before uploading. This aids users with downloading and processing the data later. Compression: Avoid compressing individual image files (e.g., into .zip or .tar.gz archives) before uploading if possible. Uploading raw or standard image formats directly allows the portal to automatically generate previews (like GIF movies) and perform basic analysis (like histograms). Use the portal's bulk upload options (Dropbox, UTBox) for transferring many files or large files efficiently. Step 1: Create or Select a Project All data on DPM belongs to a \"Project\". Log in to the DPM and navigate to the \"My Projects\" interface. Choose one: Create a New Project: Click the option to create a new project. Provide a descriptive name. Note on Ownership: For citation purposes, it's best if the primary data author is the project owner. If someone else (e.g., a student or assistant) will be uploading the data, the data owner should ideally create the project and then add the uploader as a collaborator (see Step 2). Use an Existing Project: If you are adding data to a project you previously created, simply navigate to and open that project.

The Digital Porous Media Portal. The Digital Porous Media Portal (DPMP) (formerly Digital Rocks Portal, UT Tech ID 7007 PRO) is an open data repository to organize and preserve images and related experimental measurements of different porous materials. In addition, portal hosts Applications on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources of Texas Advanced Computing Center that can be used to analyze, visualize and simulate with the data uploaded to the portal. Using data available at or uploading data to the DPMP, as well as using software Applications through the Portal, requires agreeing to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Data at the DPMP is stored in a High Performance Storage resource at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (\u201cTACC\u201d) that has built in redundancy and is continuously monitored for security and failure. On a daily basis the data is replicated so that in the event that one system fails the data can be recovered. For information, see https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/corral. The DPMP has multiple protocols and tools in place to upload data. Remote Users may experience difficulties uploading very large datasets and may contact the data curator for assistance. The DPMP will use best efforts to address questions and issues promptly. Using the Portal and Data Curation. User uploading the data agrees to present a clear, organized, well described, and reusable dataset to the DPMP. The DPMP is designed to facilitate this process by providing tools to help users organize, describe, present and access the data. The DPMP provides image services to render raw/binary data into viewable formats. It allows conducting basic image analysis such as visualization and histograms The DPMP requires metadata in order to achieve an adequate description of the dataset and some metadata is required for the images to render correctly. Uploading users are expected to describe porous imaging data using the information elements identified in the data model that purpose. The data model has been developed considering community best practices. Users that do not meet DPMP standards in describing their data will receive warnings as they enter data , Once the project is public, users will not be able to directly edit the metadata in their projects; such updates must be sent, with any needed explanatory material, to the portal's data curator Data Privacy and Publication. Users may store, organize and describe their data privately in the DPMP workspace for a period of time until they are ready to share it publicly. The private storage option is intended to keep objects out of the public view for a limited period. However, because the DPMP is an open repository, there is a limit of one year from the date of this Agreement during which a User may keep its data private. After the time elapses Users will receive a notice that the private period is ending. Upon receiving such notice, User will have 60 days to publish its data or remove the data from the DPMP repository. If no response if received within 60 days, data will be automatically removed from the DPMP. Dataset review . When a user requests publication, data curators will proceed to review the project data for accuracy. Materials submitted in a format unsupported by the DPMP, or without sufficient attribution and metadata, will not be made public by the DPMP until corrections to the data have been submitted. The data curators will do their best to initiate the review process within one month of the publication request submission and the author can follow up if that is not case, and the project publication time frame will depend on the response to the curation requests. The DPMP uses the DataCite metadata schema, for basic author and data description for purposes of citing data in conjunction with a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). When the data has been uploaded and described to DPMP standards, DOIs will be assigned upon the publication request of the project lead. A DOI is a type of persistent identifier that will be managed over time, allowing the digital object to be persistently referenced, as the identifier will not change even if the item is moved to another repository. DOIs allow your data to be cited by others and are useful to link data to a publication. If an upload involves data that has been published elsewhere and or has an existing DOI, project leads have the opportunity to reference those data sets using the External URL box or Related Publications page. The existing DOI and/or a link can be added to the data set information. Once the data is published neither the DOI cannot be deleted and the dataset is available publicly. Presently there is no versioning for issuing corrections. If users need to publish a data set derived from an existing one, they can publish a new dataset and relate them via related publications. If a user wishes to remove published dataset from the public view, this has to be justified and the process is as follows. Upon publication data creators can request to remove their data from the repository. To do so, a User must contact the repository curator and provide a justification. A record stating that the dataset was available and including an abstract and an explanation about why the data was removed will be in place. It has to be reminded that the dataset will have a DOI and that DOI will remain active so that when people use it from a citation they can verify that the data is no longer there. The DPMP is committed to help preserve your data for the long term. If for unforeseen reasons the DPMP has to cease services, the DPMP will make arrangements, free of charge, to transfer the data to another long-term repository with DOI permanence. In turn, a copy of the data will be preserved at the Texas Advanced Computing Center\u2019s tape archive. Users will be notified of changes and of location of their data with enough time so they can retrieve it along with the metadata. To analyze data from DPMP users can use TACC computational resources Industry users are referred to https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/partnerships/industry and academic, non-University of Texas at Austin users are referred to https://portal.xsede.org/#/guest. University of Texas at Austin users can create an account on https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/. Storage and maintenance fee. We will not mandate any fees for publishing or downloading the datasets from DPMP until August 31, 2026 as we are in beta testing of the new portal functionality. In August 2026, we will resume charging the publication fees. Public dataset on DPMP are open data and free for download for anyone. We invite, however, community to support the portal functionality with suggested donations as follows. 4.1. Suggested individual donation for users with private or published projects Project Size Less than 2GB 2\u2013500 GB 500GB\u20131TB Suggested Donation Free $1,500 $3,000 4.2. Institutional support donation (annual, at least for three years) for users with private or published projects Institutions (universities, companies, departments etc.) can pay a yearly fee and can have any number of members. The project is affiliated with an institution if the primary project author belongs to the institution. The fee is calculated/assessed based on the data size in all affiliated projects (published or private) at the time of establishing institutional membership and re-assessed yearly thereafter. In this case, the individual project-based fee above is waived and the fees are assessed per table below instead. Institution Less than 500GB 500GB\u20131TB 1\u20133TB Academic/non-profit $5,000 $7,500 $10,000 Company/private $7,500 $10,000 $12,500 Companies that are part of the Digital Rock Petrophysics IAP (PI Prodanovic) at UT Austin are automatically institutional members of Digital Porous Media Portal for the years they pay the IAP membership fee. 4.3. Data enthusiast donation for users with no stored data (annual) If you would like to be foundational supporter of DPMP (and get benefits of data access outline in Section 4.5), but have no projects of the size that incurs a fee, please consider annual membership as follows: Institution Data Enthusiast Individual $500 Academic/non-profit $2,000 Company/private $3,000 Storage Limits. Limits on amount of storage space per project are as set by the DPMP. For the time being, we assume the limit of 3TB and encourage users to discuss the storage limit with Dr. Prodanovic. Data Licenses. The DPMP is an open data repository and recommends that all data be accompanied by license terms so that potential users know under what conditions posted data may be reused. The default license selection is the Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By) which indicates to the users that they can freely share, modify and use the data provided that they cite the authors and that they license derivatives under the same terms and conditions of this license. Contributing users who wish to designate another license appropriate for an open repository need to send that request to the data curator. Digital Porous Media Tools is a growing collection of Python tools for image analysis of porous media. Many of the software tools are integrated into the Jupyter Notebook Application in Digital Porous Media Portal, but are also published as a standalone open source software. Disclaimers.
