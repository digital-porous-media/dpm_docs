## Getting Started

2. Create an account or sign in
3. Explore the available datasets and tools
4. Start sharing your own digital porous media data

### Set Up Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to your password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to your account and the portal.

It's essential to set up your MFA before the implementation date to avoid any disruption to your access.

1.  **Set Up Your MFA:**
    * Go to: [https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/mfa](https://accounts.tacc.utexas.edu/mfa)
    * Log in with your portal username and password.
    * Follow the detailed instructions on [https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/](https://docs.tacc.utexas.edu/basics/mfa/) to pair your account with an MFA app or SMS.

2.  **Inform Your Team:** If you manage a team or group, please ensure they are aware of this change and complete their MFA setup as soon as possible.
