# About the Digital Rocks Portal

## Our Mission and Overview

Launched in 2015, the Digital Rocks Portal (DRP) serves as a vital open repository for the geosciences and engineering communities focused on porous materials. Our mission is multi-faceted:

* **Organize and Preserve:** We provide a robust platform to securely store, organize, and preserve valuable imaged datasets and related experimental measurements of porous materials, primarily focusing on subsurface media like rocks and soil.
* **Connect and Analyze:** We strive to link these datasets with simulation, analysis, and visualization tools, thereby enhancing their scientific utility and enabling deeper insights.
* **Educate and Collaborate:** We are committed to supporting the research community by offering educational resources, organizing workshops and challenges, and fostering collaboration through data sharing.

Understanding the complex processes of flow, transport, and deformation within porous media is fundamental to addressing critical challenges in environmental science, civil engineering, petroleum engineering, and basic geology. The DRP aims to accelerate research and education in these important fields by providing access to high-quality data.

## Scope and Content Policy

The Digital Rocks Portal is specifically designed to host datasets pertinent to the study of porous materials. This includes, but is not limited to:

* 2D and 3D images (e.g., from X-ray CT, micro-CT, FIB-SEM, SEM)
* Associated experimental data (e.g., core analysis, petrophysical measurements)
* Simulation inputs and results derived from these materials.

**We require that users contributing data ensure their submissions are scientifically relevant, clearly described, well-organized, and reusable.** High-quality metadata is essential for making datasets discoverable, understandable, and valuable to the broader community. Datasets submitted without sufficient descriptive metadata, proper attribution, or in formats currently unsupported by the portal may require revision before public release. For detailed guidelines, please consult our [How to Upload Data](upload_data.md) guide and the official [User Agreement](user_agreement.md), which outlines curation standards and the publication process.

## Our Team

The Digital Rocks Portal initiative is led by **Dr. Maša Prodanović**, faculty in the Hildebrand Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin.

The portal leverages the significant capabilities of the **Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)** for high-performance storage, computing resources, and technical expertise, supported by the **University of Texas System Research Cyberinfrastructure (UTRC)** initiative. Administrative support is provided by the Center for Subsurface Energy and the Environment at UT Austin.

Our dedicated team (based on recent records) includes experts in data curation, software development, and outreach:

* **Data Curation:** Dr. Maria Esteva
* **Project Implementation:** Andrew Magill, Keith Strmiska
* **Project Curation & Digital Marketing:** Javier Estrada Santos, Hasan Khan
* **Digital Marketing:** Anuradha Radhakrishnan, Ankita Singh

We gratefully acknowledge the foundational work and significant contributions of past team members, including: Christopher Landry, Linli Ding, Mary Pettengil, Matthew Hanlon, Ashvini Venkatesh, Aditi Ranganath, Prateel Agarwal, and Gaurav Nanda.

## Connections and Community Engagement

DRP is proud to be an active participant in the broader research data ecosystem:

* An affiliated project within **EarthCube**, enhancing access to geoscience data.
* A member of the **EarthCube Council of Data Facilities**.

## Funding and Sustainability

The Digital Rocks Portal is currently supported by a grant from the **National Science Foundation (NSF GEO OSE 2324786)**.

Initial development was made possible through generous funding from NSF EAR CAREER Grant 1255622 and NSF EarthCube Grant 1541008 (2015-2018). Additional support has been provided through the industry affiliate program led by Dr. Prodanovic.

To ensure the long-term viability and continued service to the community, the DRP transitioned to a community-supported funding model in September 2021. Details regarding membership options and data storage fees can be found in the [User Agreement](user_agreement.md).

We sincerely thank all funding agencies, institutional partners, and community supporters who make the Digital Rocks Portal possible.
