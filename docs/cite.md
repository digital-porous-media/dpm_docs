**Important:** Please remember this citation is for the portal **platform**. You must also cite the specific dataset(s) you used. See the guidelines below for citing a dataset.

# How to Cite a Dataset from the Portal

Properly citing datasets you retrieve and use from the Digital Porous Media Portal (DPM) is essential for giving appropriate credit to the data creators and ensuring the transparency and reproducibility of research.

## Using the Dataset DOI

Published datasets within the DPM are assigned a persistent **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)**. This DOI ensures the dataset can be reliably located and referenced over time, even if its web address changes.


* **Find the DOI:** You should find the specific DOI prominently displayed on the landing page or metadata record for the dataset you are using within the portal.
* **Include in Citation:** When citing the dataset, please include standard bibliographic information along with the DOI. Key elements are typically:
    * Author(s) of the dataset
    * Year of publication on the portal
    * Title of the dataset
    * Publisher: Digital Porous Media Portal
    * The unique DOI (usually presented as a hyperlink, e.g., `http://dx.doi.org/...`)

* **Don't Forget to Add the Portal's Citations** 

The exact format will depend on the citation style guide required by your publisher or institution (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago, Vancouver), but ensure these core elements, especially the DOI, are included. The portal utilizes the DataCite metadata schema to help structure the information needed for proper citation.
